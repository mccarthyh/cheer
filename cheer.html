Everyone makes the sideline team. </ul><strong>Tryouts</strong><ul>The first round of evalutions take place in early June. These are more like evaluations than tryouts, just so the Coach can see what each athlete can do. These evaluations take place at Brodricks Gymnastics at the Walpole Mall.</ul><ul> Competition team tryouts are the last week of August in the WHS gym. This is where the coach decides who makes the Competition tean and who does not.</ul><strong>Schedule</strong> <ol>Practices start the last week of August, and they end the last week of November.</ol> <ol> Each week, Competition team practices are Monday-Wednesday from 2:45pm-5:00pm in the gym.</ol><ol>Game Day practices take place every Thurdsay from 2:45pm-5:00pm</ol></div></div>  <img src="images/cheerteam3.jpg" alt="wolflogo" width="350" height="275">
